# Save These Images to the images/ Folder

I've already created these from existing files:
✅ notion-icon.png (copied from notion.png)
✅ slack-icon.png (copied from Slack-logo.png)
✅ jira-icon.png (copied from jira.png)

## YOU NEED TO MANUALLY SAVE THESE 6 IMAGES:

Save the images you uploaded with these EXACT filenames in the `images/` folder:

### From First Upload (5 images):
1. **google-icon.png** - The Google "G" logo (Image 3 from first upload)
2. **gmail-icon.png** - The Gmail "M" logo (Image 1 from first upload) - REPLACE the existing one
3. **zendesk-icon.png** - The Zendesk "Z" logo (Image 5 from first upload)

### From Second Upload (4 images):
4. **bigquery-icon.png** - The blue hexagon with magnifying glass (Image 1)
5. **salesforce-icon.png** - The blue Salesforce cloud (Image 2)
6. **gong-icon.png** - The purple Gong star burst (Image 4)

## How to Save:
1. Download each image from the chat
2. Rename it to the exact filename above
3. Save it in: /Users/dhruvkapadia/Desktop/CS Demo/Village-demo-CS/images/

Once all 6 images are saved, refresh your browser and all the connector icons will appear!
